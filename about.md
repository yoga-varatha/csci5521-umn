## Class Hours
Lecture: MW 4-5:15pm - Keller 3-230. Some activities will be semi-synchronous.  
Seating is limited by available staff support, which has yet to be determined, as well as room size.

## Textbook
Introduction to Machine Learning; by Ethem Alpaydin (3rd ed, 2014, or 4th ed, 2020?).  
[Access via EBSCOHost](https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,uid&db=nlebk&AN=2957329&site=ehost-live)

## Instructor
**Prof. Yoga Varatharajah**  
Office: Keller 4-203  
Office Hours: TBD  

## Assignment Plan
### Short Assignments
2 assignments with short turn-around time (max 24 hours): 40% of final grade

### Longer Assignments
4â€“5 longer assignments: 50% of final grade

### Classroom Exercises
Several "classroom" exercises and/or pop quizzes (up to once a week): up to 10% of final grade.  

Final grades will be based on a weighted average of your scores, assuming you reach a minimum threshold in each category.

## General Information
Neural networks, non-parametric windowing, and Bayes statistical theory are three popular methods for recognizing and classifying patterns - the process of Pattern Recognition. These are the basic machine learning algorithms applicable to high-dimensional numerical data. We introduce the fundamental concepts of these various approaches, including the classification phase and the learning phase. Part of the class will be devoted to methods for unsupervised learning and classification. We assume just some knowledge of elementary statistics, calculus, and elementary linear algebra at the upper division undergraduate level, plus programming experience in python. A combination of written assignments and programming projects will be used to illustrate the concepts. All programming will be done in python.
