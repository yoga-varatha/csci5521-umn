**Class Hours**
Lecture: MW 4-5:15pm - Keller 3-230. Some activities will be semi-synchronous.
Seating is limited by available staff support, which has yet to be determined, as well as room size.

**Textbook**
Introduction to Machine Learning; by Ethem Alpaydin (3rd ed, 2014, or 4th ed, 2020?).

Office: Keller 4-203
Office Hours: TBD

**Assignment Plan** (not in order)
If the number of exams and/or assignments changes, the relative weights will be adjusted.

Several "classroom" exercises and/or pop quizzes (up to once a week): up to 10% of final grade
2 assignments with short turn-around time (max 24 hours): 40% of final grade
4--5 longer assignments : 50% of final grade
Final grade will be based on a weighted average of your scores, assuming you have reached a minimum threshold in each category.

**General Information**
Neural networks, non-parametric windowing, and Bayes statistical theory are three popular methods for recognizing and classifying patterns - the process of Pattern Recognition. These are the basic machine learning algorithms applicable to high-dimensional numerical data. We introduce the fundamental concepts of these various approaches, including the classification phase and the learning phase. Part of the class will be devoted to methods for unsupervised learning and classification. We assume just some knowledge of elementary statistics, calculus, and elementary linear algebra at the upper division undergraduate level, plus programming experience in python. A combination of written assignments and programming projects will be used to illustrate the concepts. All programming will be done in python.
