## General Information
Neural networks, non-parametric windowing, and Bayes statistical theory are three popular methods for recognizing and classifying patterns - the process of Pattern Recognition. These are the basic machine learning algorithms applicable to high-dimensional numerical data. We introduce the fundamental concepts of these various approaches, including the classification phase and the learning phase. Part of the class will be devoted to methods for unsupervised learning and classification. We assume just some knowledge of elementary statistics, calculus, and elementary linear algebra at the upper division undergraduate level, plus programming experience in python. A combination of written assignments and programming projects will be used to illustrate the concepts. All programming will be done in python.
